    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between Quiet Start and Complete Beyond emotionally?",

    },
    {
      question: "üõ†Ô∏è Will AI Complete Me keep changing over time?",
      answer: "Yes‚Äîand that's the point. We're building this with you. Features will evolve based on emotional feedback, not market trends. Early users help steer the ship."

    },
    {
      question: "‚è≥ Do I have to wait for matches to appear?",
      answer: "You might see quiet spells, especially early on. That's intentional. We focus on quality and emotional fit‚Äînot flooding your inbox. Sometimes the best connections bloom slowly."
    },
    {
      question: "üß† How does the AI matchmaking work?",
      answer: "It learns from emotional cues‚Äînot just age or location. Over time, it maps your responses, vibe tags, and story layers to surface real resonance."

    {

    },
    {
      question: "üõ¨ I signed up, but nothing's happening. Did I do something wrong?",
      answer: "Not at all. Sometimes emotional resonance takes time. If you've filled out your profile and nothing appears yet, trust the quiet. It's a feature, not a bug."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the AI guarantee love or perfect matches?",
      answer: "No. That's not its job. The AI observes patterns and emotional cues‚Äîit doesn't make promises. Connection requires curiosity, presence, and trust. We just help you notice more."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the AI guarantee romantic results?",
      answer: "AI Complete Me doesn't promise romantic destiny. It offers emotional clarity, gentle insight, and space to reflect on what truly resonates."
    },
    {
