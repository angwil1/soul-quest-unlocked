    },
    {
      question: "Is my data secure?",
      answer: "Yes, we take privacy seriously. All personal data is encrypted and we never share your information with third parties without your explicit consent."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes DateSync different from other dating apps?",
      answer: "We focus on meaningful connections through deep personality analysis, AI-powered matching, and features like video chat to help you build authentic relationships."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does DateSync cost?",
      answer: "We offer a free tier with basic features, and paid plans starting at $9.99/month for advanced features like video chat, read receipts, and priority matching."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
      answer: "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or billing portal. You'll continue to have access to premium features until your current billing period ends."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I delete my account?",
      answer: "You can delete your account through your profile settings. This action is permanent and will remove all your data from our servers."
    },
    {
      question: "üíæ What is the Memory Vault?",
      answer: "Memory Vault lives inside Unlocked Beyond. It lets you save favorite matches, prompts, and connection moments. It's your emotional archive‚Äîa way to revisit the sparks that matter."
    },
    {
      question: "üîê Is my data safe here?",
      answer: "Yes. We do not sell or share your data. We believe privacy is the foundation of trust. You're not the product‚Äîyou're the protagonist."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not getting matches?",
      answer: "Try updating your profile with more photos and information, retaking the personality quiz, or upgrading to a premium plan for visibility boosts and priority matching."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to reveal everything about myself to use GetUnlocked?",
      answer: "Nope. Vulnerability is earned, not demanded. You can start light, get your footing, and choose what to share when you're ready. Privacy-first means you control the pace."
    },
    {
      question: "What does \"emotionally intelligent matchmaking\" actually mean?",
      answer: "It means we don't just sort you by location or age‚Äîwe pay attention to emotional patterns, compatibility signals, and storytelling layers. Your inner world matters here."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between Free and Unlocked Beyond emotionally?",
      answer: "Free is like browsing poetry in a bookstore. Unlocked Beyond lets you write in the margins, remember what moved you, and take the book home. One is nice; the other is deeply yours."
    },
    {
      question: "üõ†Ô∏è Will GetUnlocked keep changing over time?",
      answer: "Yes‚Äîand that's the point. We're building this with you. Features will evolve based on emotional feedback, not market trends. Early users help steer the ship."
    },
    {
      question: "üéÅ Can I gift a subscription or Echo add-on to someone?",
      answer: "Not yet‚Äîbut this is on our radar. We believe generosity should be built-in, and we're exploring \"Matchlight Gifts\" as a future feature. Stay tuned."
    },
    {
      question: "üì∑ Can I turn off Echo features once I've activated them?",
      answer: "Always. Expressiveness should never feel performative. You can toggle badges, hide media, or mute your soundtrack any time. Echo adapts to your comfort."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want to delete my account or data?",
      answer: "You can fully delete your account and associated data in just a few taps. No hoops, no guilt trips. We'll miss you, but you won't leave footprints."
    },
    {
      question: "‚è≥ Do I have to wait for matches to appear?",
      answer: "You might see quiet spells, especially early on. That's intentional. We focus on quality and emotional fit‚Äînot flooding your inbox. Sometimes the best connections bloom slowly."
    },
    {
      question: "üß† How does the AI matchmaking work?",
      answer: "It learns from emotional cues‚Äînot just age or location. Over time, it maps your responses, vibe tags, and story layers to surface real resonance."
    },
    {
      question: "üö´ Will people see when I've saved them in Memory Vault?",
      answer: "Nope. Memory Vault is fully private. It's your archive of emotional moments‚Äînot a public signal."
    },
    {
      question: "üîç Do you have any verification or moderation?",
      answer: "Not yet‚Äîbut we're exploring consent-based, privacy-first options. We want safety without surveillance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use GetUnlocked for friendship, not dating?",
      answer: "Yes. Connection doesn't always mean romance. We're exploring an Intent overlay that lets you define what you're here for‚Äîsoftness, curiosity, co-thought."
    },
    {
      question: "üë• Will people know what tier I'm on?",
      answer: "Only if you want them to. Badges like Echo or Unlocked Beyond are toggleable. You choose what you signal."
    },
    {
      question: "üé® Can I change my profile vibe or soundtrack later?",
      answer: "Yes, whenever you want. Your emotional palette can evolve‚Äîand Echo lets you reflect that freely."
    },
    {
      question: "üõ¨ I signed up, but nothing's happening. Did I do something wrong?",
      answer: "Not at all. Sometimes emotional resonance takes time. If you've filled out your profile and nothing appears yet, trust the quiet. It's a feature, not a bug."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the AI guarantee love or perfect matches?",
      answer: "No. That's not its job. The AI observes patterns and emotional cues‚Äîit doesn't make promises. Connection requires curiosity, presence, and trust. We just help you notice more."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the video chat feature work?",
      answer: "Video chat is available for premium subscribers. Once you match with someone, you can initiate a video call directly through the app for safe, secure conversations."
