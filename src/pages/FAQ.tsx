      answer: "You might see quiet spells, especially early on. That's intentional. We focus on quality and emotional fit‚Äînot flooding your inbox. Sometimes the best connections bloom slowly."
    },
    {
      question: "üß† How does the AI matchmaking work?",

      answer: "Not at all. Sometimes emotional resonance takes time. If you've filled out your profile and nothing appears yet, trust the quiet. It's a feature, not a bug."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the AI guarantee love or perfect matches?",
      answer: "No. That's not its job. The AI observes patterns and emotional cues‚Äîit doesn't make promises. Connection requires curiosity, presence, and trust. We just help you notice more."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the AI guarantee romantic results?",
